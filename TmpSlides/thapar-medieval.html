<h3 id="org6478211">Coming of Islam:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prophet Mohammad preaching Islam in Arab</li>
<li>Followers became a political group</li>
<li>Conquered many parts of Western Asia&#x2014;Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Persia, Sind, Egypt, etc.</li>
<li>After the death of Prophet, the Arabs were ruled by series of Caliphs</li>
<li>Arabs conquered more territory&#x2014;north Africa, reached Spain and were threatening south France but were held back</li>
<li>Arabs traded with many parts of the world&#x2014;India, China, Europe and East and West Africa</li>
<li>Arabs were at war with Europe and the Mongols</li>
<li>Power of Europe had been weakened by end of Roman Empire (Rome was attacked by barbarians&#x2014;Hauns, Goths, Vandals) &#x2026; Europe in "Dark Ages"</li>
<li>Christianity became popular in Europe: Holy Roman Empire formed out of Germany, Italy and other areas</li>
<li>Emergence of feudalism in Europe: king gave land as rewards; farmers worked for the lords (also called vassals); vassals provided soldiers for kings; farmers were not slaves but treated badly</li>
<li>Europe later became interested in Arabs for two things: trade and religion (the spread of Islam worried the converted Christians of Europe)</li>
<li>Crusades</li>
<li>After the Crusades, Europeans took interest in Arab learning</li>

</ol>

<section id="slide-org5990874">
<h3 id="org5990874">Turks and the Mongols</h3>
<ul>
<li>Caliphs weakened; provinces became independent; Seljuk Turks broke away and gained power, attacking Persia, Iraq, Syria and eventually Byzantine empire</li>
<li>Civilization of Byzantium was based on ancient Greek civilization and its prosperity was due to trade.</li>
<li>In 13th cen, Seljuk Turks were attacked by Mongols (Genghis Khan)&#x2026;Turks were weakened except Ottaman Turks who had settled in Anatolia and then captured Constantinople in 1453</li>
<li>Central Asia became a useful area to control: trade between China (silk route, Chinese silk, gun powder, paper, compass, printing) and western Asia</li>
<li>Mongols had been converted to Islam; they in turn converted some tribes of Central Asia and parts of China</li>
<li>China also traded with South East Asia through ships; Arab merchants also established themselves at South East Asia</li>
<li>India's contact with Turks, Mughals started as trade (like the Europeans who began as traders and became conquerors)</li>

<section id="slide-orgd74c643">
<h3 id="orgd74c643">India during early Medieval period</h3>
<ul>
<li>Divided into kingdoms</li>
<li>Cholas were powerful in the south; reached almost as far north as Ganga; were trading with Chinese and South East Asia; much money spent on temples which were also centers of learning</li>

<ul>
<li>Kingdoms of northern Deccan tried to spread their control as far as Ganga valley</li>
<li>Religious movements of the south became popular in the north as well</li>
<li>Many brahmins from the north were invited to settle in the Deccan and the south and were granted lands</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org3f63fb0">
<h3 id="org3f63fb0">Kingdoms of the Peninsula</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rashtrakuta kingdom of the northern Deccan tried to conquer parts of Ganga valley</li>
<li>Rashtrakuta kingdom fought repeatedly against two powerful dynasties, the Pratiharas (western and central India) and the Palas (east), for the control of Kanauj and the surrounding areas</li>
<li>Rashtrakuta kingdom had also to fight the Cholas</li>
<li>Chola kings began as rulers of Tamilnad (around modern Tanjore); gradually built their power by defeating Pallava kings and local ruleres; Cholas the most powerful kingdom in the south by 11th cen</li>
<li>Pandyas (around Madurai) and Cheras (modern Kerala)</li>
<li>Rashtrakutas had been succeeded by the later Chalukyas (a dynasty related to Chalukyas) who were in turned overthrown by the Yadavas (around modern Maharastra)</li>
<li>Kakatiyas ruled in Warangal</li>
<li>Hoysalas ruled at Dvarasamudra (near Mysore)</li>
<li>Cholas had to conquer all the above kingdoms which they did until 13th cen</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgc5e9697">
<h3 id="orgc5e9697">Chola kings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Traded with South East Asia, China and western Asia</li>
<li>Council of ministers or purohits advise the king</li>
<li>Divided for administration purposes to (mandalams) provinces which are divided to valanudas</li>
<li>Each valanuda has a certain number of villages</li>
<li>In many villages, administration was carried out by villagers themselves; there were sabhas (assemblies)</li>
<li>Merchants assembled into guilds which worked as banks&#x2014;a guild consisting of merchants trading in similar goods</li>
<li>Brahmins were respected and some of them were rich; merchants rich; peasants poor; shudras had a difficult life, not allowed to enter temples</li>
<li>Temples built from contributions from kings and rich people; royal temples built of Chola kings (such as Brihadesvara temple at Tanjore) were magnificient</li>
<li>In the Pallava period, temples were rock-cut (e.g. Mahabalipuram temples near Madras)</li>
<li>Temples were meeting places of people; priests were also teachers at temples (no separate schools); taught in two languages: Sanskrit (religion taught in this language since texts such as Vedas had to be studied) and Tamil (widespoken)</li>
<li>Tamil was influenced by Sanskrit and incorporated a number of Sanskrit words</li>
<li>Telugu was spoken in Andhra; Kannada spoken around modern Mysore</li>
<li>Some religious teachers preached in Kannada or Tamil because it was the common language of the folks</li>
<li>Ramayana and Mahabharata were translated into Tamil, Telugu and Tamil</li>

<h2 id="org4fc58c1">KINGDOMS OF THE NORTH (800-1200)</h2>
<ul>
<li>post-Gupta northern India was an age of small kingdoms</li>
<li>Three large kingdoms fighting each other to gain control of the north; neither succeeded for any length of time</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org137ba28">
<h3 id="org137ba28">Struggle for Kanauj</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many campaigns in the north were fought over the city of Kanauj (had been the capital of Harasha); well-situated because whoever captured Kanauj could control the Ganga valley</li>
<li>Rashtrakutas, Pratiharas and Palas constantly fought over Kanauj and occupied in turns</li>
<li>Rashtrakutas (northern Deccan)</li>
<li>Pratiharas (southern Rajasthan?) came to power by defeating mlechchhas (a term for barbarian or outcast&#x2014;possibly Arabs who had conquered Sind)</li>
<li>By end of 8th cen, Pratiharas had captured Kanauj</li>
<li>Palas (Bengal and much Bihar) had a treaty with Tibet and encouraged trade with South-East Asia; attacked and held Kanauj for a short time</li>
<li>Bhoja (Pratihara king) recaptured Kanauj from the Palas but was defeated by Dhruva (Rashtrakuta king); Bhoja is remembered for his interest in literature and for his patronage of vaishnavism; some of his coins bore picture of varaha (boar) incarnation of Vishnu; he took the title of adivaraha</li>
<li>In 916, Rastrakutas attacked Kanauj; all three kingdoms had been weakened due to continuous fights against one another</li>
<li>Within a hundred years, all three kingdoms declined; the later Chalukyas ruled in the area Rashtrakutas had ruled; Palas were threatened by Cholas and was later ruled by the Sena dynasty; Pratihara kingdom was breaking up into number of states some of which were associated with the rise of Rajputs</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org31feafe">
<h3 id="org31feafe">Rajputs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Origins of Rajputs remain a mystery: Central Asian tribes?</li>
<li>Rajputs were divided into clans; they always insisted they were Kshatriyas</li>
<li>Their kings ordered family histories to be written which connected them with with either sun-family (surya-vamshi) or moon-family (chandra-vamshi) of ancient Indian kings</li>
<li>Four clans insisted they descended from fire-family (agni-kula); they are Pratiharas (or Pariharas), Chauhans (or Chahamanas), Solankis (or Chaulukyas) and Pawars (or Paramaras)</li>
<li>These four agni-kula clans established their power in parts of western Indian, central India and Rajasthan</li>
<li>Pratiharas ruled in around Kanauj</li>
<li>Chauhans were strong in central Rajasthan</li>
<li>Solanki power rose in Kathiawar and surrounding areas (Gujarat)</li>
<li>Pawars established in Malwa with capital at Dhar (near Indore)</li>
<li>Most of these dynasties began as small rulers under Pratiharas and Rastrakutas and later rebelled and declared their independence</li>
<li>Fightings among one another weakened these kingdoms</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org099d3cc">
<h3 id="org099d3cc">Mahmud of Ghazni</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ghazni was a small kingdom in Afghanistan founded by a Turkish nobleman in 10th cen.</li>
<li>One successor Mahmud wanted to strengthen it by annexing Central Asia for which he needed money to pay soldiers and equipments</li>
<li>India was known to be rich; so Mahmud raided northern India several times (annexed Punjab); between 1010-1025 Mahmud raided only temple towns (gold and jewellery in temples)</li>
<li>Mahmud built a beautiful mosque and a large library in his own country; he was a patron of the Persian poet, Firdausi (who wrote epic poem Shah Namah)</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org55bcf1f">
<h3 id="org55bcf1f">Muhammad Ghori</h3>
<ul>
<li>Was a ruler of a small kingdom in Afghanistan; came to annex northern India (not just for money)</li>
<li>His most important campaign was against Prithviraj III (Chauhan ruler) whom he defeated in 2nd battle of Tarain in 1192; this opened Delhi area to Muhammad</li>
<li>In 1206 he was murdered and his territory in northern India was left in control of his general Qutb-ud-din Aibak</li>
<li>Thus began the Turkish rule at Delhi</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org4d99aef">
<h3 id="org4d99aef">Economic organization (800-1200):</h3>
<p>
How could the Turks establish their rule at Delhi in a quick span of time?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Revenue collection system changed from ancient to medieval times</li>
<li>In Gupta period, some officers were paid in grants of revenue (that is, a village or a piece of land was assigned to an officer)</li>
<li>At first, the officers did not have ownership&#x2014;only the revenue generated from the land</li>
<li>In medieval period, the officers began to claim ownership of the land&#x2014;became feudatories (titled rai or thakur)</li>
<li>Brahmins also received lands and had right to collect revenue (such grants were called agrahara or brahmadeya grants); they had no further obligations to the king (could live comfortably with family off the revenue of the land)</li>
<li>Other grantees had obligations to the king such as to collect and contribute a small part of it to the king and to maintain troops for the king</li>
<li>Brahmadeya refers to land gifted to Brahmanas</li>
<li>This change in revenue system created more intermediaries (to collect the revenue) and feudatories began to depend less on the king and behave like independent rulers</li>
<li>Formerly the revenue was collected in the king's name; now it was collected in the officer's name</li>
<li>Formerly most revenue went to the king; now king's share began to decrease and king had less money to spend on the army (a reason why the north lost to Turkish attacks?)</li>
<li>Feudatories, jealous of each other, fought against each other</li>
<li>When a feudatory felt powerful enought, he would declare independence</li>
<li>Rashtrakutas began as feudatories of the Chalukyas, declared independence and overthrew the Chalukyas; they were in turn overthrown by their feudatories, the later Chalukyas</li>
<li>In the same way, Cholas began as feudatories</li>
<li>Peasants suffered the most in such system; they paid revenue and had to do free labour for the lord; often they paid extra fees for using water, roads and mills; couldn't complain to the king for the king's power over the feudatories was limited</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org7a14c3d">
<h3 id="org7a14c3d">Society (800-1200):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trade with Central Asia and Africa through Arabs; exported saffron, silk, cotton, precious stones and spices; imported horses from central Asia and Arabia; imported wine and dates from western Asia</li>
<li>Shudras had the most difficult life; they were peasants and cultivators</li>
<li>Apart from shudras, there were untouchables who did lowly work</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1eeff39">
<h3 id="org1eeff39">Eduation and learning (800-1200):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brahmins were responsible for performing religious ceremonies and teaching</li>
<li>In addition to Sanskrit, other languages were developing (known as regional languages today); they arose out of apabhramsha (spoken by common people)</li>
<li>In sanskrit, apabhramsha literally means broken or crooked (as in broken grammar)</li>
<li>Early forms of Marathi and Gujarati were being spotted in western India and Bengali in eastern India</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1028dd0">
<h3 id="org1028dd0">Religion (800-1200):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The spread of bhakti teachings, begun by Tamil devotional saints, to the north helped in the development of new languages</li>
<li>Bhakti teachers preached in regional languages to reach out to lower caste people</li>
<li>The popularity of bhakti movement led to decline of Buddhism; in medieval period, Buddhism remained popular only in eastern India, having the support of the Pala kings</li>
<li>Buddhism no longer the simple religion Buddha taught; when Turks attacked the monastery at Nalanda, the Buddhist monks fled to SEA</li>
<li>Both shaivism and vaishnavism had large followings in the north; Krishna was the most frequent worshipped form of Vishnu; Rama was also popular</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org3b65e0f">
<h3 id="org3b65e0f">Architecture and painting (800-1200):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every important king and every powerful feudatory built a temple</li>
<li>In Orissa, the more impressive ones are at Puri (Jagannath temple) and Bhubaneshwar (Lingaraj temple), and the Sun temple at Konarak</li>
<li>Khajuraho Group of Monuments (present Madhya Pradesh) were built by Chandella kings</li>
<li>A group of Dilwara Jaina temples built in white marble at Mt. Abu (Rajasthan)</li>
<li>Pala kings were patrons of Buddhism and Hinduism</li>
<li>Older tradition of murals continued on the walls of temples and palaces</li>
<li>A type of painting started during this period and would later become extremely popular during Mughal period&#x2014;miniature painting&#x2014;that is, painting tiny pictures as illustrations to books</li>
<li>Miniature painting: Jaina monks (western India), Buddhists (Nepal, eastern India) were very fond of illustrating their manuscripts; they painted small pictures on palm-leaves showing the scenes described in the text; at first it was very simple but slowly they put in more colors and it became detailed</li>

<section id="slide-orgd89bc61">
<h3 id="orgd89bc61">Slave Sultans (1206-1290)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mamluks were the earliest rulers of the Delhi Sultanate; they were also known as Slave Kings because many of them were either slaves or sons of slaves who had become Sultans</li>
<li>Qutb-ud-din Aibak (general of Muhammad Ghori) established a kingdom; ruler of Ghazni tried to annex it but failed; Iltutmish succeeded Aibak and was known as the effective founder of the Delhi Sultanate</li>
<li>Sultans of Delhi gradually extended their control up to Bengal in the east and Sind in the west</li>
<li>Ruling over the Sultanate was hard; revenue system existed; Turkish nobles and slaves from Central Asia had settled in India; Sultans granted them revenue but not the ownership of the lands but found it difficult to keep them contented</li>
<li>The local rulers had been conquered but the Sultans had to keep them under control; some Rajputs were hostile</li>
<li>New trouble further north: Afghan rulers were quiet but Mongol people under Genghis Khan made fresh conquests; area along Indus river came under Mongol domination and they would attack Punjab every now and then; for some years they conquered Punjab and threatened the Sultanate</li>
<li>The above were some problems which Sultan Iltutmish had to face; his daughter ruler Raziya faced the same problems as well</li>
<li>Sultan Balban defended the Sultanate from the Mongols, fought against local rulers, subdued the nobles who had become very powerful and threatened the position of Sultan</li>
<li>Sultan Balban encouraged people to do sijdah in his presence (kneeling and touching the ground with forehead); this horrified the orthodox Muslims who believed all men are equal</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org39a6023">
<h3 id="org39a6023">Khalji Sultans (1290-1320)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Young Sultan Ala-ud-din was very ambitious, wanted to become second Alexander and conquer the world, began an all-India empire plan</li>
<li>Mongols had now been converted to Islam but they still threatened the Sultanate</li>
<li>Needed money to build strong army: Ala-ud-din increased land taxes on the wealthy people of Doab (fertile area between Ganga and Yamuna)</li>
<li>Ala-ud-din campaigned against the kingdoms of Gujarat and Malwa and tried to establish his control over Rajasthan</li>
<li>Ala-ud-din sent a large army under Malik Kafur to peninsula to not just conquer but obtain wealth; Kafur plundered in all directions and even attacked Madurai (no north Indian army had managed to come so far south before)&#x2014;for a brief period Ala-ud-din ruled over an empire almost as large as that of Ashoka (although his control over Deccan was indirect)</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org08b5c31">
<h3 id="org08b5c31">Tughluq Sultans (1320-1399)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tughluqs also wanted to rule an all-India empire; they succeeded at first (even ruled over Deccan directly) but they became weak; governors of some distant provinces and southern areas rebelled and claimed independence</li>
<li>Muhammad-bin-Tughluq was a man of ideals and tried to rule with reason; he had as advisers a mathematician and a logician; he wanted to conquer Central Asia as well</li>
<li>Muhammad increased the taxes of peasants in Doab area; there was a famine and people refused to pay and rose in rebellion; the Sultan cancelled his order</li>
<li>Muhammad transfered the capital from Delhi to Devagiri (he renamed Daulatabad)(near modern Aurangabad) which would have been a better place for controlling the Deccan; it was failure (was too far and difficult to keep watch on the north) and had to return to Delhi</li>
<li>Southern kingdoms saw this as weakness; two independent kingdoms arose in Deccan&#x2014;Bahmani and Vijayanagara</li>
<li>Muhammad, in attempt to obtain more money, decided to issue 'token' coins in brass and copper which could be exchanged for silver coins from the treasury (would have worked if he ensured that only the govt was issuing the 'token' coins) but many people started making brass and copper 'tokens' and he had no control over the finances; tokens were therefore discontinued</li>
<li>Muhamad was succeeded by Firoz</li>
<li>Firoz's death led to civil war among his descendents; governors of many provinces became independent; finally only a small area around Delhi remained in the hands of Tughluq Sultans</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org91e2f9d">
<h3 id="org91e2f9d">Break-up of the Delhi Sultanate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turkish chief Timur raided the north, killed its people and returned to Samarkand with the loot</li>
<li>Tughluq dynasty ended and a local governor occupied Delhi, founding Sayyid dynasty which lasted quite short&#x2014;an Afghan noble with family name Lodi usurped the throne</li>

<h3 id="orgbb04e6b">Lodi dynasty (1451-1526)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sikandar Lodi controlled Ganga valley as far as western Bengal; moved capital from Delhi to a new town (later became famous as Agra)</li>
<li>Ibrahim, the last of the Lodi Sultans, was opposed by the leading Afghan nobles who plotted (asked for help) with Babar (king of Kabul) and overthrew him&#x2014;also with help of other Rajput princes</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org6088259">
<h3 id="org6088259">Nobles</h3>
<ul>
<li>sometimes influenced state policy, sometimes as governors revolted and became independent rulers or else usurped the throne of Delhi</li>
<li>most of nobles came of Turkish or Afghan families which had settled in India</li>
<li>after the time of Ala-ud-din Khlji, Indian Muslims and Hindus were also appointed as officers</li>
<li>officers got grant (revenue) instead of salary; this grant was not hereditary; officers were responsible to maintain law and order in his territory (where he collected revenue from)</li>

<ul>
<li>Some sufis came from Persia and other lands, settled in the north and gain Indian followers</li>
<li>emphasized love and devotion as means of nearing God</li>
<li>Prayers, fasts and rituals were not so important as true love of God</li>
<li>tolerant of other religions and sects</li>
<li>orthodox ulema did not approve of the sufis believing that some sufi teachings were not in agreement with orthodox Islam</li>
<li>Many Hindus revered the sufis</li>
<li>Sufis did not try to convert Hindus to Islam but advised them to be better Hindus by loving the one true God</li>
<li>Muin-ud-din Chishti, sufi saint, maintained that devotional music was one way of coming close to God (ulema did not approve of this)</li>

<h3 id="orgbf4f0be">Bhakti</h3>
<ul>
<li>The alvars and the nayannars of Tamil devotional cult started the tradition of preaching the idea of bhakti through hymns and stories</li>
<li>most of the bhakti saints were non-brahmins</li>
<li>Nanak's teachings were compiled in a scripture called the Adi Granth by his 4th successor in early 17th cen</li>
<li>Like other saints, Nanak rejected casteism and insisted his followers must be willing to eat in common kitchen&#x2014;langar&#x2014;no matter their caste</li>
<li>Nanak grouped his followers together and before his death appointed a guru to be their leader</li>
<li>the later bhakti saints like Nanak and Kabir also influenced social ideas (not just religious ones)&#x2014;rejected casteism; encouraged women to join menfolk in various activities; women were also included in their followers gathering; some of the finest hymns were composed by women</li>

<h3 id="org3f16a4b">Language and literature</h3>
<ul>
<li>bhakti teachers used local or regional languages to preach</li>
<li>Braj and Avadhi&#x2014;two forms of Hindi&#x2014;were used</li>
<li>Punjabi was beginning to emerge in the north, Gujarati in western India, Bengali in eastern India, Marathi in north-west Deccan, Kannada in around Mysore, Telugu in Andhra</li>
<li>Oriya, Assamese, Sindhi and Malayalam originated around this time</li>
<li>Court language in most parts of the country was Persian&#x2014;thus Persian influenced many regional languages</li>
<li>Urdu was born out of the mixture of Hindi and Persian&#x2014;the grammar was same as of Hindi but words were taken from Persian, Turkish and Hindi</li>
<li>Urdu spoken in the Deccan was more strongly influenced by Telugu and Marathi</li>
<li>Gradually Urdu was the most commonly spoken language in towns</li>
<li>Arabic in the west coasts from western Asian traders and Arabic influenced local languages as well</li>
<li>Sanskrit was limited to rituals, ceremonial occasions in certain Hindu courts</li>
<li>Literature included not only translations of Sanskrit epics but those poetry, epics, plays written in regional languages</li>

<h3 id="org778f266">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>True arch and the dome were the two most important architectural forms most widely used</li>
<li>Indian architects, before the coming of the foreigners, didn't experiment much with true arch and dome styles</li>
<li>After the coming of new styles, both dome and true arch were widely used in mosques, palaces, tombs and in due time, private houses as well</li>
<li>Minarets (tall, slender tower) were also frequently used&#x2026; e.g. Qutb Minar with the mosque nearby built in the reigns of the Mamluks</li>
<li>the citadel of Firoz Tughluq called Firoz Shah Kotla</li>

<h3 id="org9324d25">Age of discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>1453, Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople</li>
<li>Turks were already in control of a large part of western Asia</li>
<li>This was a heavy blow to Europe because much of the trade with Asia came through this region</li>
<li>Necessary for European merchants to find a new route to India and Asia</li>
<li>Why trade with Asia? Because spices (used for preserving meat and this was the only way to preserve meat in bitter cold northern Europe) came from Asia and a lot of European cities depended on Asian trade</li>
<li>Trade in Asian spices was in the hands of the Arabs: they brought them to the markets of western Asia and sold them to Italian merchants who then sold to other parts of Europe</li>
<li>Most convenient land route through the central Asia was now closed to the Europeans</li>
<li>Very little was known about Africa (except northern parts) and nothing was known about the Americas</li>
<li>1488, Bartholomew Diaz (Portuguese) sailed down the west coast of Africa and reached the Cape of Good Hope</li>
<li>Vasco da Gama followed Diaz's route, then continued along the east coast of Africa and across the Arabian sea and arrived in India (Kerala) in 1498&#x2014;discovering sea route to India</li>
<li>The Portuguese then attacked Arab trading settlements, captured the trade from the Arabs, began trading in spices</li>
<li>Columbus (Italian), paid by the king of Spain, thought if he sailed to west from Spain he would arrive in Asia; he reached the West Indies</li>
<li>1497, Amerigo Vespucci sailed to America (named after Amerigo?)</li>
<li>Existence of the American continents was finally proved in 1519 when Magellan sailed around the world: from Spain to South America, across the southern Pacific Ocean to Oceania, Southeast Asia, across the Indian Ocean to Africa, and along Africa's west coast back up to Spain</li>
<li>The Spanish did not discover the sea route to India, so could not profit from Asian trade but discovered in America two great civilizations: Aztecs (Mexico) and Incas (Peru)</li>
<li>European sailors had used maps which had come down from Geek and Roman times but with new discovery, new maps were drawn</li>
<li>Europeans took two instruments from the Arabs: astrolabe and quadrant: used to measure latitude of a given point</li>
<li>Before the use of these instruments, sailors had to rely on star positions</li>
<li>Invention of the mariner's compass improved sea travel</li>
<li>The Protuguese invented moveable sails which could be adjusted according to the direction of the wind; winds could now be used in any direction and speed was increased</li>

<h3 id="orgb594c5c">Reformation and counter-reformation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decline of Portugal and Spain and rise of other European countries was partly due to changes in religious scene in Europe</li>
<li>Christiany dominant religion in Europe throughout Dark Ages until Renaissance</li>
<li>Until this time, Christianity divided into two: Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox</li>
<li>Greek Orthodox (centered at Constantinople) claimed thier version was older and more orthodox version</li>
<li>Roman Catholics (centered at Rome) was later in date and accepted form all over northern and western Europe</li>
<li>Pope, head of the Church, was powerful in both religious and political matters throughout the medieval period</li>
<li>The authority of the Pope and Church was threatened; people began to question their involvement in secular matters such as politics</li>
<li>The Church had collected taxes and had been granted land; members lived in luxury&#x2014;this was against the principles of Christ's teaching</li>
<li>A number of Christians broke away from the Catholic Church in early 16th cen led to formation of the Protestants (protesting against the Catholic Church)</li>
<li>Some Christian theologians such as Martin Luther, Erasmus and John Calvin denounced the Church</li>
<li>Long wars were fought between the Catholics and the Protestants</li>
<li>The merchants of the North European cities approved of Protestantism which encouraged a spirit of inquiry and stressed the importance of individual human being and were not opposed to Renaissance</li>
<li>Some northern European countries like England, Holland and the Scandinavians accepted Protestantism as their religion; France was divided&#x2014;in these countries, merchants used the knowledge of the scientists</li>
<li>Reformation having taken place in northern Europe, counter-reformation began to take place in Catholic countries of sourthern Europe</li>
<li>Catholics of Spain led this movement: to reform Catholicism&#x2014;Society of Jesus or Jesuits was founded (one such this was Francis Xavier who worked in India and died there)</li>
<li>Catholic Church rejected the reformation; instead, it became more orthodox</li>
<li><i>Inquisition</i>: the trials of those critical of the Church (they were punished, sometimes burnt to death)</li>

<ol>
<li>Akbar, only 13 in 1556, ascended the throne when his father died</li>
<li>His guardian Bairam Khan looked after the govt, administration and war until he was old enough to do so himself</li>
<li>Hemu and Bairam Khan fought at Panipat; Mughals reoccupied Delhi and Agra (Hemu was a general of one Afghan prince and had made himself strong in the kingdom of Sher Shah)</li>
<li>Akbar came of age and conquered many towns and forts such as Gwalior, Ajmer and Juanpur and annexed the kingdom of Malwa</li>
<li>Akbar wanted to have friendly relations with Rajputs; use marriage alliance; he himself married many Rajput princesses; he also gave Rajputs high offices in his administration (e.g. Raja Man Singh)</li>
<li>Akbar also had to fight against those Rajput princes who opposed him (e.g. Rana Pratap). Two powerful forts of Rajasthan&#x2014;Ranthambor and Chittor&#x2014;were captured by the Mughals</li>
<li>Akbar conquered
<ul>
<li>Gujarat (overseas trade revenue of Gujarat now came to Mughal)&#x2014;Gujarat had been trading with both Arabs and Europeans</li>
<li>Bengal (valuable because of the its rich and fertile land and of overseas trade with south east Asia)</li>
<li>Kashmir, Sind, Orissa, central India and Qandahar (Afghanistan)</li>

<ol>
<li>Had elements from existing Indian system and borrowings from Central Asia and Persia</li>
<li>In villages and towns, little was changed; most existing systems remained and most officers were Hindus; far away villages were unaware of the dynasty change; Mughal rule was gradually felt</li>
<li><i>Mansabdari</i> system: 
<ul>
<li>Every noble, officer or civil servant was given a rank or a <i>mansab</i> and he was known as a <i>mansabdar</i></li>
<li>The rank was valued in terms of number of mounted soldiers; troops maintained as such could be used by the emperor whenever needed</li>
<li>The rank was lifetime but not hereditary (his son had to be appointed to his own rank)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Emperor was helped by various officers: <i>wazir</i> (revenue administration) and <i>bakshi</i> (military organization); chief steward <i>(khan-i-saman)</i> attended to the royal household; chief <i>qazi</i> held the highest position among the judges</li>
<li>The emperor interacted with the people:
<ul>
<li><i>Diwan-i-Khas</i> (hall of private audience)</li>
<li><i>Diwan-i-am</i> (hall of public audience)</li>
<li><i>Jharokha</i> (the balcony of his palace): near which the people would gather to see him</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Organization (or division) of the empire:
<ul>
<li><i>Subas</i> or provinces; pattern of administration at the capital was repeated in each <i>suba</i>; there were 15 <i>subas</i> during Akbar's reign</li>
<li>Each <i>suba</i> was divided into <i>sarkars</i> and each <i>sarkar</i> into <i>parganas</i></li>
<li><i>Subadar</i> (governor of <i>suba</i>) looked after the administration of his <i>suba</i> with the help of other officers</li>
<li>The <i>diwan</i> kept revenue records from the land; <i>bakshi</i> sent regular news reports to the capital and attended to the needs of the army in the <i>suba</i></li>
<li>The <i>kotwal</i> was the officer in charge of town administration, was reponsible for catching criminals and was sort of census officer (kept a register of all persons in the neighbourhood including visiting foreigners); police stations are still sometimes called the <i>kotwali</i>;</li>

</ul></li>
<li>To prevent a officer from becoming corrupted or too powerful, Akbar insisted they should be transferred after sometime</li>

<section id="slide-org54e69a5">
<h3 id="org54e69a5">Income of the state</h3>
<ol>
<li>Officer salaries were paid in <i>jagirs</i> (grants of land revenue); the state took one-third of the produce (Raja Todar Mal was asked to make a land revenue estimate)</li>
<li>Trade revenue not as large as land revenue but in areas where trade prospered, such as Gujarat and Bengal, the <i>suba</i> got richer; Indian traders exported textiles, indigo, saltpetre and spices</li>
<li>Europeans visited the court of Akbar in connection with overseas trade; Portuguese trading settlements on the west coast; English merchants envious of the Portuguese and tried to get Akbar's permission to trade in the same places but Akbar was not too keen</li>

<h3 id="org4eef5e9">Literature and the fine arts</h3>
<ol>
<li>Progress of science in India could have been more rapid if Akbar had shown interest in Renaissance or natural sciences.</li>
<li>Akbar had discussions with two brothers&#x2014;Abul Fazl and Faizi. Abul Fazl wrote a book <i>Akbarnama</i> (life of Akbar) of which a section is the famous <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> which deals with the empire's laws and revenue system and the condition of the country. Faizi was a poet in Persian.</li>
<li>Persian was the official language. Akbar encouraged translation of Sanskrit works into Persian. Entire <i>Mahabharata</i> and <i>Ramayana</i> were translated and Abul Fazl wrote the preface.</li>
<li>Many poets began writing in Hindi such as Vallabhacharya, Keshavadasa and Rahim. Rahim's <i>dohas</i> (couplets) are still recited. Tulsidas wrote <i>Ramacharitamanas</i> (story of <i>Ramayana</i>).</li>
<li>Tansen, a singer, was close to Akbar, frequently seen at his court, enriched the <i>Hindustani</i> music by making additions in the style of singing many of the <i>ragas</i>, such as <i>raga Darbari</i> which some people say, was composed especially for Akbar. <i>Hindustani</i> music had now taken many features from Persian music.</li>
<li>Painters in Akbar's court made miniature paintings in a mixture of Indian and Persian styles (colours were Indian and the delicacy was Persian); many  painters being lower caste Hindus did not worry the emperor</li>
<li>Books were no longer written on palm-leaves or birch-mark but on paper (Chinese invention); 13th cen Indian traders imported paper; books were written in <i>nastaliq</i> (Persian script) and <i>devanagari</i> by hand although printing press had been invented and were being used in China and Europe.</li>

<li>Akbar's court was at Delhi and Agra but Akbar built his new capital city at Fatehpur Sikri (he chose this because the <i>sufi</i> saint Salim Chisti lived there) where he built palaces in red sandstone&#x2014;the architecture is a blend of Persian, Central Asian and Indian styles.</li>
<li>Mughal-style tombs: Akbar built his father Humayan's tomb&#x2014;has more Indian features than the previous Sultans' style and is placed in a middle of a large, well laid out garden with a massive gateway as entrance (this is common feature of Mughal-style tombs.</li>
<li>Mughal architecture at this time took many features from earlier Indian styles: square brackets at the entrances, cave design, etc. and Mughal style influenced architecture of Hindu rulers: palaces of Rajput princes and Govind Dev Temple at Vrindaban is made of red sandstone and has mixed style.</li>

<li><p>
Based on common truths of all religions, Akbar propounded <i>Din-i Ilahi</i> or monotheism. Claiming to be the spiritual guide of his people, he
</p>
<ul>
<li>favoured peace and tolerance,</li>
<li>discouraged animal killing, suggested to stop eating meat at least for a few days every year,</li>
<li>disapproved of cruel punishments and mutilations (better to make a criminal realize his fault rather than just mutilate him),</li>
<li>strongly disapproved of women becoming <i>satis</i>,</li>
<li>introduced veneration (worship) of the sun, fire and light in his ritual.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Those who accepted him as spiritual guide took a vow that they would be prepared to sacrifice their property, their honour, their religion and their life for the emperor.
</p></li>
<li>Some nobles at his court such as Raja Birbal became sincere followers; others did only to please him and there were others like Raja Man Singh who openly disapproved of it; Akbar did not insist that they follow his religious teachings; some Muslim nobles worried that this religion might destroy Islam.</li>
<li>Akbar's dream was that India should be united as one country and people should forget their differences.</li>
<li>1605, Akbar died and was burried in a tomb which he had started building for himself at Sikandra.</li>

<li>Like most royal princes, young Jahangir was appointed governor of Avadh and Bengal; succeeded his father Akbar in 1605 when the latter died; he shared Akbar's interest in social and religious reforms but never studied the problems of religion as deeply as his father; he was fond of literature and well-read, wrote in Persian, his memoirs <i>Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri</i>.</li>
<li>Married Nur Jahan who set the fashion in dress and manners at the court and also took an interest in state matters (when Jahangir was ill or unavailable); she became powerful that even coins were issued jointly in the name of Jahangir and Nur Jahan.</li>
<li>Jahangir's reign was quieter compared to what were to follow; Jahangir continued his father's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajputs; Kangra was conquered.</li>

<ol>
<li>1658 Ascension; long reign almost 50 years but full of troubles; empire at its largest, over nearly the whole of India; system of governing had changed a lot since Akbar days and revolts broke out in many parts of the empire.</li>
<li>The Deccan kingdoms&#x2014;Bijapur and Golconda&#x2014;were never actually annexed; they had become weak while the Marathas were gaining in strength; Aurangzeb had to send armies to the Deccan to prevent the Marathas from overpowering the Deccan.</li>

Then revolts of Marathas under Shivaji; chieftans revolted; Jats of Mathura revolted; some revolts were supported by peasants for taxes had increased from 1/3 to almost half; trouble with the Rajputs; and worse, Aurangzeb made campaigns against Sikhs (bad thing because Pubjab was a rich area and provided fair amount of revenue; tax problems got entangled with religious problems as well.

<h3 id="orgcbaad16">The Sikhs</h3>
<ol>
<li>By 17th cen, Sikhism became widespread among peasants and artisans of Punjab; Guru Nanak succeeded by a series of 9 gurus; the earlier ones mainly on relgious aspects of Sikhism but the later ones became miltary leaders of the Sikhs as well.</li>
<li>After the death of the 7th guru, Aurangzeb tried to take advantage of the differences over the succession of the next guru; Sikh power was increasing gradually; to curb this power, the Mughal administration ordered the execution of Guru Teg Bahadur in 1675; the 10th and last guru Govind Singh organized Sikh soldiers and prepared them for battle against the Mughals; Afghan soldiers were also recruited into the Sikh armies who carried raids in various places.</li>
<li>Sikhs were now known as the <i>khalsa</i> (meaning "pure"). They couldn't establish an independent state during Aurangzeb's reign (but they achieved this in 18th cen). Mughals became much weaker in 18th cen; everyone was grabbing territory.</li>

<h3 id="org075f3b7">Aurangzeb: The End</h3>
<ol>
<li>Aurangzeb had problems with the Portuguese and English; the Portuguese pirates renewed their activity in the Bay of Bengal using Chittagong as a base; Mughal armies captured Chittagong and also annexed the eastern part of Bengal.</li>
<li>English pirates threatened the west coast by attacking Indian ships; the Mughal govt threatened the English factory at Surat (wherefrom they traded with India) that unless they stopped the English pirates and paid a fine of 1.5 lakh rupees, the govt would not allow trade anymore; the English paid the fine and stopped the pirates from their raids on the west coast.</li>
<li>Aurangzeb, influenced by an orthodox Muslim group, tried to rule in accordance with the laws of Islam; this was a policy different from that of his tolerant and liberal ancestors</li>

</ol>

<section id="slide-org7b169fb">
<h3 id="org7b169fb">Religion at the Mughal court</h3>
<ol>
<li>17th cen Mughal court divided into two&#x2014;orthodoxy and liberals; Indian converted Muslims still continued traditions from pre-conversion, having been influenced by liberal ideas; liberals continued traditions established by Akbar.</li>
<li>Young prince Dara Shukoh was a liberal, brilliant mind and extremely well read; his best known work was a study of <i>sufi</i> and <i>vedanta</i> philosophy showing how similar they were; he translated <i>Upanishads</i> into Persian (this translation was later retranslated into Latin and thus the <i>Upanishads</i> were read for the first time by European philosophers); unfortunately Dara Shukoh was killed in the fight for the throne between him and his brother Aurangzeb.</li>
<li>Orthodoxy was led by Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi, who had lived during Akbar and Jahangir reigns; he was an impressive teacher and influenced many people at the court; he established a centre where his disciples and pupils continued his work.</li>
<li>Despite being orthodox, Aurangzeb was sincere in his religious beliefs; he became unpopular when he reintroduced <i>jaziya</i> (poll-tax on non-Muslims) and when he destroyed temples.</li>

</ol>

<section id="slide-org4841514">
<h3 id="org4841514">Revenue</h3>
<ol>
<li>European merchants were chiefly interested in Indian textiles, and eagerly bought cargoes of <i>malmals</i> from Dacca (East Bengal), silks from Banaras and cotton textiles from Surat, Ahmedabad and Madurai; foreign traders eagerly sought pepper from Malabar.</li>
<li>The English merchants formed themselves into the East India Company; first they set up a factory at Surat and later spread to other parts of the coastal areas; in Bengal they were allowed to trade anywhere they wished and the local governor was paid a small sum in return for this right (this payment was nothing compared to the large profits made by the Company).</li>

</ol>

<section id="slide-orgea74e8f">
<h3 id="orgea74e8f">Architecture and Art</h3>
<ol>
<li>In Akbar's time, most buildings were made of red sandstone; now they were built of the more expensive marble from Rajasthan (e.g. Itimad-ud-Daulah at Agra); Shah Jahan's reign is remembered for the beautiful buildings which he designed and had built: combined many of the finest features of Indian and foreign architecture (domes, decorated arches, tall minarets, balconies, broad drooping eaves, small pavilions) and the proportions of the buildings are well balanced; Mughal architecture was no longer as impressive by Aurangzeb's reign (many buildings were copies).</li>
<li>Jahangir was most fond of paintings; his court attracted many of the best artists of the time: Bishan Das, Murad, Mansur and Bahzad; he was curious of European techniques when introduced to it by Thomas Roe; big change occured during Aurangzeb's reign; he disapproved of painting and would not let artists work at the court.</li>

<section id="slide-org9bcb247">
<h3 id="org9bcb247">Music</h3>
<ol>
<li>Hindustani music was popular at the Mughal court but Aurangzeb in his later years developed a dislike for music; many musicians went to provinces and small kingdoms; new styles of singing such as <i>khayal</i> which had been developed in the Mughal court and the <i>thumri</i> became popular in the new centres.</li>

</ol>

</section>
<section id="slide-org5a52efb">
<h3 id="org5a52efb">Literature</h3>
<ol>
<li>Persian continued to be the official language of the court while in towns and villages, people used Hindi and Urdu.</li>
<li>Poets, apart from Kabir and Tulsidas, became popular. Surdas, blind poet of Agra, composed <i>Sur Sagar</i> which is recited to this day. Raskhan, Muslim nobleman, composed <i>Prem Vatika</i> (poems on the life of Krishna). The <i>Satsai</i> of Bihari was also popular.</li>
<li>Poets began writing in Urdu and 18th cen Delhi and Lucknow were centres of Urdu poetry.</li>
